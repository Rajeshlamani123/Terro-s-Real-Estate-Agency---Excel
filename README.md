## Problem Statement (Situation):
### “Finding out the most relevant features for pricing of a house”
Terro’s real-estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. The pricing is
concluded based on different features / factors of a property. This also helps them in identifying the
business value of a property. To do this activity the company employs an “Auditor”, who studies
various geographic features of a property like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities
(pupil to teacher ratio), connectivity (distance from highway), etc. This helps in determining the price
of a property.
The agency has provided a dataset of 506 houses in Boston. Following are the details of the dataset:
